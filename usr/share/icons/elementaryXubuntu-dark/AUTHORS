"elementary Xubuntu" dark is based mainly on elementary-mono-dark, it just adds some missing icons and symlinks for Xfce. This addon to the elementary icon-theme was done by Simon Steinbeiß <ochosi@shimmerproject.org> for Xubuntu 11.04.

Additional icons used for sound-notifications were taken from Ubuntu's Notify-OSD icon-theme, which was designed by Kenneth Wimer (copyright notice below).
